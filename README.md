Made for a smarthouse implementation. By using two [ultrasonic sensors](https://www.parallax.com/sites/default/files/downloads/28015-PING-Documentation-v1.6.pdf) on each side of the door the sensors is used to detect transitions between two rooms. The code is designed as a state machine using c function pointers and transition tables.
