# Embed_proj
Sub-module for a smarthouse implementation. By using two [ultrasonic sensors](https://www.parallax.com/sites/default/files/downloads/28015-PING-Documentation-v1.6.pdf) on each side of the door the sensors is used to detect transitions between two rooms. The code is designed as a state machine using c function pointers and transition tables. For a more thorough review I suggest reading the project report located in this repository.
